    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>    
    <p>
        Hello, everyone! My name is Tharakadatta Devaru Hegde, and I hail from the picturesque town of Sirsi in Karnataka, India. However, I spent my formative years in the vibrant city of Hubli, also in Karnataka. It was there that I completed my 12th grade, which laid a strong foundation for my academic journey. Currently, I am pursuing my studies at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Jodhpur.
        
        Outside of academics, I have a keen interest in exploring various hobbies. One of my greatest passions is reading books, as they offer a gateway to different worlds and perspectives. Additionally, I find solace and joy in playing the Tabla, a classical Indian percussion instrument that has captured my heart with its enchanting rhythms.
        
        When I'm not lost in the pages of a book or engrossed in the rhythms of the Tabla, I love immersing myself in the world of movies. Exploring different genres and stories on the silver screen is not only entertaining but also offers me valuable insights into the art of storytelling.
        
        Furthermore, history has always fascinated me. I find great pleasure in delving into the annals of the past, uncovering the triumphs, struggles, and lessons of civilizations and individuals who have shaped our world. It serves as a reminder of our collective journey and inspires me to learn from the past as I shape my future.
        
        In addition to my diverse interests, I have an inclination towards coding and programming. The ever-evolving world of technology ignites my curiosity, and I am constantly driven to expand my knowledge and skills in this field. I believe that coding holds immense power to shape the future and create innovative solutions to real-world problems.
        
        With an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a deep passion for exploring various realms, I am excited to embark on new experiences, expand my horizons, and contribute meaningfully to the world around me.
